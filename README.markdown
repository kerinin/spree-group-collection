Object Group
=========

ObjectGroup is an extension to Spree's ProductGroup class which adds the following functionality:

- Compose multiple Product Groups into a single named collection with it's own permalink
- Union collections (as opposed to intersection collections)
- Associate Product Group collections with users allowing users to define 'saved searches'
- Composable collections; ObjectGroups can be build from other ObjectGroups
- Polymorphic collections allowing scopes defined on multiple object classes to be collected into a single search result
